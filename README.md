FB Design
Open your eyes and ask yourself "who is the most likely user of this page?"
For each page everything is clearly laid out so that the user most likely using that page is where they should be. Ie. The about page has most information a person might want to know. The photo page is just for photo browsing and the news feed is exactly that: a place where friend news is fed to you. 
What is that user's critical goal on that page?

The users critical goal is being able to find information on people. Whats new, who is this, what are they about?
Does the visual hierarchy you sketched lead to that goal?
It does, although there is a lot of information the most prominent information is readily avaialable, centered in the center column. Clicking on a persons name or photo brings you to their page. The primary functions are above the fold and secondary actoions are usually a click away. 

Do the relationships between the elements lead you to that goal (remember your CRAP principles)? The website is spaced out with padding and margins, small but effective you also find information grouped in boxes. Post to post, column seperation. Headers and tags remain consistent and it is usually clear whether they are meant to be clicked or are simply headers.  Font stays the same and so does color and nav bars. The experience is very fluid.

What font families are most prominent on the page? (use the WhatFont add-on or your browser's developer tools to inspect this). The entire site is in Helvetica. This provides a clean modern look and a consistency that is easy on the eyes and makes extended reading easier. You know what to expect on every page. 

How do these font families contribute to or take away from the site's flow?
Having a font that stays the same adds a lot to the flow. Different fonts could confuse you and guide you away from whats important. With Helvetica you don't even usually think about the font which is perfect.

How do the line spacings, sizes and weights contribute to or take away from the site's flow? For the most part facebook align to a grid very nicely and the usual structure of pages is 3 columns. An easy on the eyes blue I believe helps facebook maintain a clean, reliable look. The only page the weight feels off is the news feed on the right column there is a lot of clutter. There is information about trending events and people I don't know. Friends actions. I feel this space just adds little to the experience of that page .

What would you improve to achieve a better hierarchy or flow? On the home page logged out: I would Have an explaination of what facebook is. For new users there is no information and the whole thing is very assumptive. On the news feed I would clean up a lot of the clutter, hide the friends chat statuses and show something like a widget for the user to decide the content shown or a most popular picture area. 

FB UX


    Who is the main user of Facebook?
The main user is anyone who wanrs to keep updated on whars going on with friends or communities or also share information.
    What are the top 3 critical goals for that user?
Read the latest posts, create their own posts, and look at their latest notifications

    What is the site's approximate information architecture? (in general -- don't get caught up in the details too much)
sign up/in > Home page/ news feed     Read extended comments

                         Create post                             edit profile
                         Comment                                 messaging
                         Like                                    chat
                         Read Notifications
    
For your top user goal, what is likely to make the user's experience particularly satisfying?
Being able to quickly respond & view notifications as well as post and view comments and new posts.
    To accomplish this goal, how does the user flow through the site's architecture? (ie. which pages are visited and what are clicked?)
    
When logged in every main feature is available and visible to you. The main features you click are videos, notifications and expanding comments. From there you can go further into setting, the search results, or individual groups. 
    What style(s) of navigation is/are used? Do they answer the key questions (Where am I and how did I get here? Where should I go next and how do I get there?)?
    
The top nav bar always stays the same. Side nav bar directs you everywhere else. Consistent logo placement always takes you home. Lots of windows are pop ups and can always be closed if you want to go back. It is very easy to navigate, however it can be more complicated when moving forward into something like say, settings and certain security features.

What does Facebook do well to allow the user to accomplish the top goal effectively, efficiently and with good satisfaction? Yes it does, most everything is above the fold and right there. Simply by scrolling down you can get unlimited new content. 
    
    What does Facebook do poorly when allowing the user to accomplish the top goal effectively, efficiently and with good satisfaction? Occasionally the news feed will jump back up to the top of the page. It tends to notify you of friends activities that aren't very important. This is the main problem of facebook having to guess what content you want to see. Another thing I've noticed as a user over the years is there is just so much content and features that it becomes somewhat cluttered and over bearing. It used to be so much cleaner and that was what I missed.
